Prof. Mohsen Razavi, from [University of Leeds](http://www.leeds.ac.uk/), visited our group from Nov. 5th to Nov. 10th.

Mohsen's research interest is on the practical quantum cryptogrphy, especially the construction of quantum communication networks. During his visit, he introduces his recent works on wireless quantum key distribution (QKD) and tight finite-key analysis of twin-field QKD.
