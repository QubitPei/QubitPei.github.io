The Quantum Information and Quantum Communication Theory group in [Center for Quantum Information](https://cqi.tsinghua.edu.cn), [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn), Tsinghua University mainly focus on the quantum information theory and its application in information processing. Some of the questions guide the research:

- How to quantify the quantumness contained in quantum information processing tasks?
- How to build the large scale quantum networks and quantum computers?
- How to take to advantage of quantum information processing in the specific communication tasks?

New Ph.D and Postdoc Position is now open! Contact [Xiongfeng Ma](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/maxiongfeng/) for more details.
